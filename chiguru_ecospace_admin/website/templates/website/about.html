    <p>Experience nature and celebrate diversity, the thought itself leaves profound impact on any human mind. 
        A small initiative to listen to nature, understand life in its completeness and realise symbiosis between various forms of life began a decade ago closer to Thippagondanahalli Reservoir, off. Bangalore – Magadi Road at Singadasanahalli village, just 40 kms away from busy Bangalore streets and has now started bearing fruits. This is ‘Chiguru Eco-space – a 10+ acre privately owned, certified organic farm’ located in a valley between 2 villages (Singadasanahalli and Kalluru) and needless to say, surrounded by beautiful scenic views.
        Chiguru is a Bio-diversity education farm targeting young minds and progressive farmers. Creating awareness about sustainable and chemical free farming, native plant and animal diversity, their cultural values and importance of conserving them are the core objectives of this farm. 
        Chiguru, known for conservation of traditional varieties of vegetables, food grains, medicinal plants and livestock has been certified as fully organic since 2005. It is mostly self sustained and receives no external inputs what-soever except for Bio-fertilizers. The farm has a thriving eco-system with over 150 identified species of plants, 50+ species of birds and wildlife population.
        A definite highlight of Chiguru is its Punganur cattle family. The elite native Indian breed that produces the best quality milk is nearly extinct with just over 200 of them left on this planet!! Chiguru has partnered with like-minded individuals and organisations in conservation efforts of this noble breed.
        Other dwellers of Chiguru include a dog (Mudhol hound), goats, sheep and a good flock of native chicken.
        Chiguru creates various opportunities for interested minds to actively engage and learn the idea of sustainability. Some of these initiatives are as follows : 
        Beeja Siri (Treasure of Seed)
        Seeds are the origin of life. Unfortunately, this critical gift of nature has now been commercialised to an extent that seeds are internationally traded as a mere commodity. Beeja Siri is an initiative to conserve and promote traditional agro diversity. It is a forum to celebrate the diversity that nature has to offer and to broadcast the criticality of saving our rich seed culture. 
        Hejje Guruthu (Foot Prints)
        Extent of our association with nature has a profound impact on formation of our personality. This association during the initial years is even more important as a person is normally ‘created’ within the first 6 years of his life. Hejje Guruthu is a day long (or shorter as per the need) farm visit that provides the tiny tots less than 7 years old(and their parents), an opportunity to relish themselves within the cradle and warmth of mother earth. Kids are exposed to fun-filled activities within a caring farm atmosphere.
        Anveshana (Discovery)
        True to its name, Anveshana is an opportunity for children to explore and discover the amazing facets of nature and natural living. It is a hands-on farming and Bio-Diversity Awareness program usually conducted as a 3-day residential event for children in the age group of 7 – 15 years. The children enjoy this exposure and cherish the new learnings for life. Camp activities are often an extension to regular day-to-day farm activities. Qualities such as caring for others, social living and shared responsibility, decision making, minimising waste, managing new challenges and leading are picked-up and demonstrated naturally. 
        Susthira Krushike (Sustainable Agriculture)
        This is an initiative targeted at rural youth to help them understand the opportunities of Sustainable and integrated farming practices. Retaining rural youth within villages and helping them realise the potential of rural entrepreneurship based on value addition of their farm produce are the main objectives of this program. 
        Through a day long workshop, youngsters are exposed to the benefits of integrated and co-operative farming, crop selection, value addition, market analysis and product positioning. The program envisages to create enough interest and opportunities for staying back and carving out a successful and respectable career within their villages.
